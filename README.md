# Singleton Utility for Unity

## Introduction
The `Singleton` utility, part of the `com.Klazapp.Utility` namespace, is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. Singletons are commonly used to manage global state, resources, or services in a Unity project.

## Features
- Ensures that there is only one instance of the class within the Unity application.
- Provides a global point of access to the single instance, allowing other parts of the code to easily interact with it.
- Allows controlled initialization of the singleton instance, typically in response to the first request for the instance.

## Dependencies
To use `Singleton`, certain dependencies are required. Ensure these are included in your Unity project.
- **Unity Version**: Minimum Unity 2020.3 LTS.
